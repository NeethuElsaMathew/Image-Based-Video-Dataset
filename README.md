# Image-Based-Video-Dataset
Videos in Master Branch.
This repository consists of 100 different videos.
The repository contains the Python scripts used to create videos which are encoded using H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC video codec.
The code and the video file of corresponding shapes is available in the master branch. There are video files of 10 different shapes.
Among these 5 shapes are created using the OpenCV library and the video codec used in them is H.264/AVC. And those are 

1) Circle
2) Hexagon
3) Octagon
4) Pentagon
5) Point

The next 5 shapes are created using the FFMPEG library and the video codec used is H.265/HEVC. The shapes are
1) Square
2) Rhombus
3) Rectangle
4) Trapezoid
5) Triangle

The videos are generated using different specifications such as different image resolutions, different colours and different fps(Frames per seconds).
And in total there are 100 different videos created.
