This readme file will help you navigate through this folder structure.

This repository contains 100 videos of different geometrical shapes.
All the videos present in the master branch are either encoded in H.264/AVC or H.265/HEVC video codec.

There are two folders FFMPEG and OpenCV.Along with these the scripts used for the creation of these videos are also attached here which are "video_circle_point.py", "video_ffmpeg", "video_opencv".These are the standard scripts used for the creation of these videos since the specifications are configurable within the scripts when have modified these script parameters like video codec, frame size and frames per second (fps) to generate 100 different videos.

For Example, The FFMPEG folder consists of all the videos which are made using the FFMPEG library. There are videos of 5 geometrical shapes and those shapes are triangle, rectangle, rhombus, square and trapezoid. Inside the FFMPEG folder, there are two more folders

For Example, The OpenCV folder consists of all the videos which are made using the FFMPEG library. There are videos of 5 geometrical shapes and those shapes are point, circle, pentagon, hexagon, and octagon. Inside the FFMPEG folder, there are two more folders.

1) AVC videos -> 1024*1024 pixel videos and 800*600 pixel videos
2) HEVC videos -> 1024*1024 pixel videos and 800*600 pixel videos

To create a diverse set of videos we have used different specifications for the videos. Even though the video appears to be the same each video differs to one another depending on the specifications used for video construction. The specifications which are configurable and changed in each video are :

            1) Video codec: H.264/AVC or H.265/HEVC
            2) Frame size: 1024*1024, 800*600
            3) Frames per second (fps): 30, 15
